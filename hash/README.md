## Handling Integer Overflow in kdb/q

### Overview

When working with unsigned integers in kdb/q, you may need to convert signed integers to their unsigned equivalents by performing modulo operations.
However, kdb/q has limitations when dealing with 64-bit integer arithmetic that can cause overflow issues.

#### 32-bit Unsigned Integers

For 32-bit unsigned integers, you can use straightforward modulo arithmetic:
```q
q)floor mod[;2 xexp 32]11241262407
2651327815
q)floor 2 xexp 32
4294967296
```

This works because `2^32` (4,294,967,296) is within kdb/q's representable integer range.

Python equivalent:
```python
>>> 11241262407 % 2**32
2651327815
```

#### 64-bit Unsigned Integers: The Problem

For 64-bit unsigned integers, the modulo approach fails due to integer overflow:
```q
q)floor mod[;2 xexp 64] -8787571747770567168
0N
q)floor 2 xexp 64
0N
```

The value `2^64` (18,446,744,073,709,551,616) exceeds kdb/q's maximum representable long integer, resulting in a null value (`0N`).

Python handles this correctly:
```python
>>> -8787571747770567168 % 2**64
9659172325938984448
>>> hex(-8787571747770567168 % 2**64)
'0x860c460dcfe07600'
```

### Solution: Binary Representation Method

Instead of using modulo arithmetic, you can extract the unsigned representation directly from the binary encoding using kdb/q's `-8!` operator (binary serialization).

#### For 64-bit Unsigned Integers

```q
q)-8!-8787571747770567168
0x0100000011000000f90076e0cf0d460c86
q)reverse -8#-8!-8787571747770567168
0x860c460dcfe07600
```

**Explanation:**
- `-8!` serializes the integer to binary format
- `-8#` takes the last 8 bytes (64 bits)
- `reverse` converts from little-endian to big-endian representation

**Update:**

```q
q)0x0 vs -8787571747770567168
0x860c460dcfe07600
```

#### For 32-bit Unsigned Integers

The same technique works for 32-bit integers:
```q
q)-8!11241262407
0x0100000011000000f9470d089e02000000
q)reverse -4_-8#-8!11241262407
0x9e080d47
```

**Explanation:**
- `-8!` serializes the integer to binary format
- `-8#` takes the last 8 bytes
- `-4_` drops the last 4 bytes (leaving the first 4 of the 8-byte representation)
- `reverse` converts from little-endian to big-endian representation

**Update:**

```q
q)-4#0x0 vs 11241262407
0x9e080d47
```

Python verification:
```python
>>> hex(11241262407 % 2**32)
'0x9e080d47'
```

### Summary

| Bit Width   | Method            | Code                          |
| -           | -                 | -                             |
| 32-bit      | Modulo (works)    | `floor mod[;2 xexp 32] value` |
| 32-bit      | Binary extraction | `reverse -4_-8#-8!value`      |
| 64-bit      | Modulo (fails)    | ❌ Overflow                   |
| 64-bit      | Binary extraction | `reverse -8#-8!value`         |

### Key Takeaways

- kdb/q's `2^64` overflows, making direct modulo operations impossible for 64-bit unsigned conversions
- Binary serialization with `-8!` provides a reliable workaround
- The binary method works consistently for both 32-bit and 64-bit integers
- Always use `reverse` to convert from kdb/q's little-endian storage to standard big-endian hex representation
